# Portfolio

This portfolio contains some recent projects I have completed. Below is a description of each:

Drake:
This project utilized an object model for discrete random variables in order to utilize the Drake equation in predicting the number of
advanced civilizations in the galaxy capable of interstellar communication. After generating the number of advanced civilizations based on the DRV class, the N distribution was plotted in a histogram. 

Lyric:
This project created a reusable extensible framework for natural language processing for songs. Using the Genius API, the discographies for ten different musical artists were scraped, and three different comparative visualizations were implemented. A sankey diagram highlighting similarities and overlap for common words between artists' discographies, as well as wordclouds to visualize the most common words for each artist individually. The last visualization shows the cosine similarity between the ten artists. 

Sundash:
This project created an interactive dashboard using an API created through SQLite in order to visualize sunspot data. This dashboard displays visualizations that allow the user to gather more meaningful insights from graphs created by the sunspot dataset. With graphs visualizing patterns in the sunspot cycle, users are able to see clear trends in the sunspot activity over time, as well as the variability in number of sunspots over a user selected range of years. It provides means for a user to conveniently explore the dataset through the sliders and dropdown menus, which allow the user to look at the data over a selected time period, as well as to select which images to display.
